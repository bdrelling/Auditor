**Auditor** is a tool used to ensure GitHub repositories across users and orgs are aligned and up to date with a common set of rules or expectations.

**This is not a reusable package**, as it is only configured for [bdrelling](https://github.com/bdrelling)'s repositories. However, feel free to copy and modify however you'd like.
